# Sensor Modules as a Transformation Pipeline

Implementing a new Sensor Module should require only adding necessary and sufficient code corresponding to the new functionality. To that end, every Sensor Module can be implemented as a pipeline of reusable transforms.

# Motivation

## High-level API

Within a Thousand Brains System, the high-level Sensor Module API is to accept a `SensorObservation` from the environment and return an optional `Percept`, and a (possibly empty) sequence of `Goal`s.

![Sensor Module API](./0000_sensor_modules_as_transformation_pipeline/sensor_module_api.png)

## Transform Domains

Within the high-level API, there are four functional transform domains that loosely need to happen in the following sequence:

1. **Transforms** that operate on the raw environmental observation. For example: truncating depth information, adding noise, gaussian smoothing, translating depth modality into 3D coordinates, etc. Historically, these were a part of environment utilities.

2. **Feature Extractors** that turn environmental observation into a Cortical Messaging Protocol (CMP) Percept. For example: extracting features like principal curvatures, estimating pose vectors, converting RGB to HSV, determining if pose is fully defined, adding noise to the Percept features, etc.

3. **Filters** that determine whether the Percept should be sent to the Learning Module or not. For example, if the features changed sufficiently to warrant sending a message.

4. **Goal Generators** that create Sensor Module CMP Goals that will go directly to the Motor System.

The sequence is not exact, as Goal generators can be absent, or they can generate Goals based on raw observations, processed Percepts, or both. Similarly, filters can occur at any point in the process. The raw observations tend to be processed to create the Percept that will then be filtered, but this is not always the case.

## Sensor Module Creation

Historically, in order to create a new Sensor Module, the Contributor needed to implement a new, bespoke Python class that inherited from the abstract `SensorModule` class. All of the functionality of the Sensor Module would then be implemented within the `SensorModule.step()` method. It is very likely that the new Sensor Module would share functionality with already existing Sensor Modules. For example, the [CameraSM](https://github.com/thousandbrainsproject/tbp.monty/blob/e280beea563d579e4e5418a4abac0ab44bb84207/src/tbp/monty/frameworks/models/sensor_modules.py#L659), [TwoDSensorModue](https://github.com/thousandbrainsproject/tbp.monty/blob/e280beea563d579e4e5418a4abac0ab44bb84207/src/tbp/monty/frameworks/models/two_d_sensor_module.py#L193) shared the initial raw environmental observation Transform functionality via the [ObservationProcessor](https://github.com/thousandbrainsproject/tbp.monty/blob/a664f3935aae3abfef3d2061b573bed972c03992/src/tbp/monty/frameworks/models/sensor_modules.py#L115) component. They both had a configurable `MessageNoise` and `PerceptFilter` components. On the other hand, [SalienceSM](https://github.com/thousandbrainsproject/tbp.monty/blob/a664f3935aae3abfef3d2061b573bed972c03992/src/tbp/monty/frameworks/models/salience/sensor_module.py#L36) shared no common functionality with either of them, and [Probe](https://github.com/thousandbrainsproject/tbp.monty/blob/a664f3935aae3abfef3d2061b573bed972c03992/src/tbp/monty/frameworks/models/sensor_modules.py#L433) only logged the observation contents without any processing.

Writing bespoke sensor module implementations was toilsome, especially if functionality was being reused. Even with shared components like the [ObservationProcessor](https://github.com/thousandbrainsproject/tbp.monty/blob/a664f3935aae3abfef3d2061b573bed972c03992/src/tbp/monty/frameworks/models/sensor_modules.py#L115) there was still a lot of repetitive code.

## Reusable Components

Given the high-level API along with the general transform domains, it ought to be possible to design sensor modules as a data flow pipeline of reusable components, such that a new sensor module can be created entirely via configuration. Any functionality that does not exist, ought to be written in a generic way that can later be reused by a different sensor module. This way, new functionality is written once, and reused multiple times.

## Faster Research

The faster we can create different kinds of sensor modules with minimal mistakes, the faster the research feedback loop.

# Details

A Sensor Module is a data flow pipeline that begins with a `SensorObservation` and ends with an optional `Percept` and a (possibly empty) collection of `Goal`s.

![Sensor Module API](./0000_sensor_modules_as_transformation_pipeline/sensor_module_api.png)

We use a generic `SensorModule` to minimize the amount of code and tests required to implement new functionality. The generic `SensorModule` requires a `TransformPipeline`, which is a series of `Transform`s that process and mutate a `Payload` consisting of a `SensorObservation`, a `Percept` or `None`, and a `list[Goal]`. At the end of the transform pipeline, the contents of `(Percept | None, Collection[Goal])` is returned by the sensor module.

![Sensor Module Implementation Overview](./0000_sensor_modules_as_transformation_pipeline/implementation_overview.png)

A sensor module can thus be assembled via configuration. If new functionality is required, one creates and tests a new `Transform` and assembles it along with the already existing `Transform`s to instantiate a new type of sensor module.

## Implementation

Internally, the Sensor Module data pipeline is assembled from a series of transforms that implement the `sensor_module.RuntimeTransform` protocol.

```python
class RuntimeTransform(Protocol):
    def __call__(self: Self, ctx: TransformContext, payload: Payload) -> Payload:
        ...
```

Where `Payload` and `TransformContext` are:

```python
@dataclass
class Payload:
    observation: SensorObservation,
    percept: Message | None,
    goals: list[Goal]

@dataclass
class TransformContext:
    rng: np.random.RandomState
    state: AgentState | None = None
    motor_only_step: bool = False
```

Additionally, we have a `tbp.monty.experiment.sensor_module.ExperimentTransform` to support experimental use case where the experiment wants to reset all Monty internals between episodes and epochs. I think a less intrusive approach would be for the experiment to reconstruct Monty between each episode and epoch instead.

```python
class ExperimentTransform(Protocol):
    def reset(self: Self) -> None: ...
```

Since we typically need to implement both protocols, we have the combined:

```python
class Transform(RuntimeTransform, ExperimentTransform, Protocol):
    def reset(self: Self) -> None:
        pass
```

The combined `Transform` protocol provides a default `reset()` implementation, as not all transforms can be reset.

We define an `identity_transform` needed to "ground out" the transform pipeline:

```python
def identity_transform(
    ctx: TransformContext,  # noqa: ARG002
    payload: Payload,
) -> Payload:
    return payload
```

In order to fully assemble a Sensor Module, two additional boilerplate components are needed, the `TransformMiddleware` and the `TransformPipeline`:

```python
TransformMiddleware = Callable[[Transform], Transform]


class TransformPipeline(Transform):

    _transform: Transform
    # _transforms are only retained for reset()
    _transforms: list[Transform]

    def __init__(self: Self, transforms: Sequence[TransformMiddleware]) -> None:
        self._transforms = []
        transform = identity_transform
        for next_transform in reversed(transforms):
            transform = next_transform(transform)
            self._transforms.append(transform)
        self._transform = transform

    def __call__(self: Self, ctx: TransformContext, payload: Payload) -> Payload:
        return self._transform(ctx, payload)

    def reset(self: Self) -> None:
        for transform in self._transforms:
            transform.reset()
```

With the above specifications and boilerplate in place, we can now author a generic `SensorModule`:

```python
class SensorModule(RuntimeSensorModule, ExperimentSensorModule):

    _agent_state: AgentState
    _goals: list[Goal]
    _sensor_id: SensorID
    _sensor_module_id: SensorModuleID
    _sensor_state: SensorState
    _transform_pipeline: TransformPipeline

    def __init__(
        self: Self,
        sensor_module_id: SensorModuleID,
        sensor_id: SensorID,
        transform_pipeline: TransformPipeline | None
    ) -> None:
        self._sensor_module_id = sensor_module_id
        self._sensor_id = sensor_id
        self._transform_pipeline = (
            transform_pipeline
            if transform_pipeline is not None
            else TransformPipeline([])
        )

    @property
    def sensor_module_id(self: Self) -> SensorModuleID:
        return self._sensor_module_id

    def propose_goals(self: Self) -> Collection[Goal]:
        """Return the goals proposed by this Sensor Module."""
        return self._goals

    def step(
        self: Self,
        ctx: RuntimeContext,
        observation: SensorObservation,
        motor_only_step: bool = False
    ) -> Message | None:
        """Process an observation into a percept and goals.

        Args:
            ctx: The runtime context.
            observation: Sensor observation.
            motor_only_step: Whether the current step is a motor-only step.
        """
        transform_ctx = TransformContext(ctx.rng, self._agent_state, motor_only_step)
        payload = Payload(observation, None, [])
        payload = self._transform_pipeline(transform_ctx, payload)
        self._goals = payload.goals
        return payload.percept

    def update_state(self: Self, agent: AgentState) -> None:
        """Update information about the sensor's location and rotation."""
        self._agent_state = agent
        sensor = agent.sensors[self._sensor_id]
        self._sensor_state = SensorState(
            position=agent.position
            + qt.rotate_vectors(agent.rotation, sensor.position),
            rotation=agent.rotation * sensor.rotation,
        )

    def reset(self: Self) -> None:
        self._transform_pipeline.reset()

```

It is worth highlighting in this implementation how the type of the `Goal` collection is handled. Internally, each transform invocation receives a payload with a _mutable_ `list[Goal]` and returns a payload with a _mutable_ `list[Goal]`. This way, any transform in the chain can edit the collection of `Goal`s as required by the transform. Initially, the transform pipeline is handed a payload with an empty list `[]` and, at the end, the pipeline returns a payload with a possibly non-empty `list[Goal]` to the sensor module, which is stored at `self._goals`. However, when the `Goal`s finally exit the sensor module via `propose_goals()`, they exit as a read-only `Collection[Goal]`.

## Creating a Transform

New functionality is introduced by creating a new `Transform`.

The general pattern is to accept `next_transform: Transform` in the constructor and to finish the `__call__` implementation by invoking the `next_transform`.

```python
class MyTransform(Transform):

    _next_transform: Transform

    def __init__(
        self: Self,
        next_transform: Transform,
        # ...
    ) -> None:
        self._next_transform = next_transform
        # ...

    def __call__(self: Self, ctx: TransformContext, payload: Payload) -> Payload:
        # ...
        return self._next_transform(ctx, payload)

    def reset(self: Self) -> None:
        # override the default no-op reset if needed ...
```

Note that it is possible to "early exit" out of the chain of transforms by not calling `self._next_transform`. For example:

```python
    def __call__(self: Self, ctx: TransformContext, payload: Payload) -> Payload:
        # ...
        return payload
```

While it is possible, as of this writing there are no specific use cases for this feature.

### Transforms

Raw environmental observation transforms focus on updating the `SensorObservation`. For example, if we were to write a `MissingToMaxDepth` transform:

```python
class MissingToMaxDepth(Transform):

    _next_transform: Transform
    _max_depth: float
    _threshold: float

    def __init__(
        self: Self,
        next_transform: Transform,
        max_depth: float,
        threshold: float = 0.0
    ) -> None:
        self._next_transform = next_transform
        self._max_depth = max_depth
        self._threshold = threshold

def __call__(self: Self, ctx: TransformContext, payload: Payload) -> Payload:
        m = np.where(payload.observation["depth"] <= self._threshold)
        payload.observation["depth"][m] = self._max_depth
        return self._next_transform(ctx, payload)
```

### Feature Extractors

The main feature extractor is the `ObservationProcessor`. Rewriting the current version of it as a `Transform` would result in the example below. Note that the main change is the addition of `_next_transform` instance attribute and ending the `__call__` implementation with `return self._next_transform(ctx, payload)`.

```python
class PerceptIsNotNone(RuntimeError):
    """Raised when percept should be None but isn't."""

class ObservationProcessor(Transform):
    """Processes SensorObservations into Cortical Messages."""

### Filters

Filter transforms' main purpose is to filter. As an example, implementation of the `FeatureChangeFilter` as a `Transform` would look as follows. Note that we provide a non-default `reset()` method that resets the filter:

```python
class FeatureChangeFilter(Transform):

    _next_transform: Transform
    _delta_thresholds: dict[str, Any]
    _last_percent: Message
    _last_sent_n_steps_ago: int

        self: Self,
        next_transform: Transform,
        delta_thresholds: dict[str, Any]
    ) -> None:
        self._next_transform = next_transform
        self._delta_thresholds = delta_thresholds
        self._last_percept = None
        self._last_sent_n_steps_ago = 0

    def reset(self):
        self._last_percept = None

### Goal Generators

Some Sensor Module transforms may generate goals. For example, implementing the `SalienceSM` goal generation as a `Transform` would look something like:

```python
class Salience(Transform):

    _next_transform: Transform
    _sensor_module_id: str
    _salience_strategy: SalienceStrategy
    _return_inhibitor: ReturnInhibitor

    def __init__(

        next_transform: Transform,
        sensor_module_id: str,
        salience_strategy: SalienceStrategy | None = None,
        return_inhibitor: ReturnInhibitor | None = None,
    ) -> None:
        self._next_transform = next_transform
        self._sensor_module_id = sensor_module_id
        self._salience_strategy = (
            Uniform() if salience_strategy is None else salience_strategy
        )
        self._return_inhibitor = (
            ReturnInhibitor() if return_inhibitor is None else return_inhibitor
        )

    def __call__(self: Self, ctx: TransformContext, payload: Payload) -> Payload:
        salience_map = self._salience_strategy(
            ctx=ctx,
            rgba=payload.observation["rgba"],
            depth=payload.observation["depth"]
        )

        )
        salience = self._weight_salience(ctx, on_object.salience, ior_weights)

        payload.goals.extend([
            Goal(
                location=on_object.locations[i],

        ])

        return self._next_transform(ctx, payload)

    def _weight_salience(
        self,
        ctx: RuntimeContext,
        salience: np.ndarray,
        ior_weights: np.ndarray,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
        weighted_salience = self._decay_salience(salience, ior_weights)

        weighted_salience = self._randomize_salience(ctx, weighted_salience)

    ) -> np.ndarray:

    ) -> np.ndarray:

        weighted_salience += ctx.rng.normal(
            loc=0, scale=randomness_factor, size=weighted_salience.shape[0]
        )
        return weighted_salience

    def _normalize_salience(self, weighted_salience: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
        if weighted_salience.size == 0:
            return weighted_salience

        min_ = weighted_salience.min()
        max_ = weighted_salience.max()
        scale = max_ - min_
        if np.isclose(scale, 0):
            return np.clip(weighted_salience, 0, 1)

        return (weighted_salience - min_) / scale

    def reset(self) -> None:
        self._return_inhibitor.reset()

## Configuration

# Drawbacks

## Increased importance of integration tests and benchmarks

Transferring more of the sensor module "business logic" to configuration results in system behavior being defined in the configuration. This puts it outside the domain of unit testing. The individual transforms can be unit tested, improving their individual reliability. However, verifying how the configured ensemble of transforms behaves now falls onto integration testing and benchmarks.

## Verbosity

While it is almost pleasant to read a single sensor module configuration laid out as a pipeline of transforms, this will get old when we have many sensor modules, especially if the configuration is repetitive. Hydra is uniquely terrible at allowing us to reuse portions of lists in a configuration. The general rule is that, when Hydra combines configuration fragments, objects are composed/combined, whereas lists are replaced in their entirety. We will likely have to handle this by creating some bespoke resolves that reduce the toil of repeating a configuration over and over again. Note that this issue is not unique due to the changes in this RFC, but also exists (or will exist after some changes) for specifying multiple learning modules.

## Positioning Procedures need their own transforms

Prior to the implementation of this RFC, the `PositioningProcedure`s took advantage of shared environment transforms happening inside the `Environment`. This RFC moves those transforms to the head of the sensor module transform pipeline. However, this means that positioning procedures now need their own transforms before processing. Despite this, there appear no architectural constraints that prevent positioning procedures from incorporating a sensor module `TransformPipeline` before their own processing, effectively reusing some of the sensor module transform functionality.

# Rationale and alternatives

The main rationale behind this design is that it is a well exercised industry method of handling configurable and flexible data-plane-like computation. In essence, this RFC implements the [Chain of Responsibility behavioral pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/chain-of-responsibility), also known as middleware. The configurable and flexible aspects of the solution are appealing from research perspective. Reusing existing functionality and only authoring truly new functionality should speed up the research feedback cycle. Similarly, reusing existing functionality and only authoring truly new functionality improves engineering testing and maintenance. Reusing already tested components is simpler than creating new ones. There is also less code to maintain.

There were no other designs considered. This RFC originated from pattern matching the current state of sensor module architecture against an existing industry pattern that should result in improvements.

## Status Quo

If we do not proceed with this RFC, the internals of every new sensor module can still be reused as components. When adding a new sensor module, even when reusing existing components, a new sensor module class will need to be created in order to explicitly arrange the data flow between components specific to the new sensor module.

Without the imposed `Transform` structure, new sensor module functionality may not be immediately reusable. That is, when a new sensor module is created, it does not need to create reusable components. The work to componentize for reuse would likely be done by a follow-on contributor that wanted to reuse functionality in their own sensor module. Additionally, what can be reused may not be as clear to follow-on contributors as looking at a well-defined `Transform` class.

# Prior art and references

This RFC implements the [Chain of Responsibility behavioral pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/chain-of-responsibility), also known as middleware. This is [a common](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware/) [framework pattern](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/middleware/index.html) [in HTTP](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/topics/http/middleware/) [request-handling](https://spiral.dev/docs/http-middleware) [servers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/middleware/?view=aspnetcore-10.0).

# Unresolved questions

It is unclear how toilsome it will be to configure many sensor modules and how much sensor-modules-via-configuration approach will contribute to the toil.

# Future possibilities

## Experiment could reconstruct Monty between each episode

The generic Sensor Module approach described in this RFC works within the contemporary experimental framework limitations. That is, the contemporary experimental framework relies on much Monty internals having experiment-specific methods to facilitate resets and related experimental activity.

One pervasive use case for experiment-specific methods throughout Monty is to reset all of Monty between each experimental episode and epoch, except for the models learned inside the learning modules. An alternative approach would be to reconstruct all of Monty between each episode and epoch. The only desired persistence between the episodes are the models learned inside the learning modules. If Monty could be instantiated from a snapshot containing only learning module memory, this would allow for removal of experimental code from within Monty.
