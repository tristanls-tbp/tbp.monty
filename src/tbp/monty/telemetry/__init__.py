"""Structured telemetry framework built upon the `logging` module.

Provides a structured telemetry module that emits inline telemetry events routed through
standard Python `logging` mechanics. Telemetry schemas are passed as the log message
(``msg``) to `logging.Logger.log`, so handlers receive them as ``record.msg``.
``record.getMessage()`` returns ``schema.kind``.

The telemetry level must be configured via the experiment config YAML. Easiest is adding
"  - /telemetry: info" under "defaults:". Available configs are "info" and "warning".

The global level is defined via the ``telemetry.tbp.monty`` logger. It can be overridden
on a per-module basis.

Config example::

    experiment:
      config:
        telemetry:
          loggers:
            # Global level
            telemetry.tbp.monty:
              level: CRITICAL
            # Module-specific level
            telemetry.tbp.monty.frameworks.models.graph_matching:
              level: INFO

Usage example::

    from tbp.monty import telemetry
    from tbp.monty.telemetry.schemas import TelemetryEvent

    telemeter = telemetry.getTelemeter(__name__)
    telemeter.info(TelemetryEvent(kind="CustomEvent", your_key="your_value", ...))
    telemeter.debug(TelemetryEvent(kind="DebugEvent", ...))

Handler example::

    class MyHandler(logging.Handler):
        def emit(self, record):
            event = record.msg  # the TelemetryEvent instance
            ...

    """Routes ``telemetry.*`` names to ``TelemetryPublisher``-typed loggers.

    ``logging`` notes that "Loggers should _NEVER_ be instantiated directly, but always
    through the module-level function ``logging.getLogger(name)``."

    Installed as ``Logger.manager.loggerClass``, this class is invoked by
    ``Manager.getLogger`` to construct loggers it hasn't seen: ``rv = (self.loggerClass
    or _loggerClass)(name)``. Names not prefixed with ``telemetry.*`` are passed through
    to whatever logger class the process would otherwise have used.

    A factory is needed here because ``TelemetryPublisher`` subclasses
    ``logging.Logger`` and so, per ``logging``'s rules, must never be instantiated
    directly. This factory class is itself never instantiated either: its ``__init__``
    never runs, as its ``__new__`` always returns another object (hence the ``# type:
    ignore[misc]``).

    It is installed on the manager rather than globally via ``logging.setLoggerClass``
    so it can't be picked up as a base class by libraries that do ``class
    LibLogger(logging.getLoggerClass()): ...``, which would block their subclass from
    being instantiated. It is decoupled from ``logging.getLoggerClass()``, which avoids
    the possibility of accidental inheritance, while still being checked first by
    ``Manager.getLogger``, so telemetry names are still always caught.

    This placement also ensures thread-safety: ``Manager.getLogger`` calls the factory
    while holding the logging lock, so dispatch happens atomically with the logger
    dictionary, unlike swapping the global logger class around a ``getLogger()`` call,
    which would race with other threads.

    The non-telemetry branch resolves the fallback class on every call (so a class
    installed later is honored), falling back to ``_manager_logger_class`` to preserve
    any manager-level class set before this one.
